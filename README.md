# Thank You { Electrical Art } ---CRUMB-CIRCUIT-SIMULATOR---
Big electronics project that shows "Thank You😄" in big breadboard and very complex systems✨

Here materials that i use :
- Arduino Nano x1
- LM555 x1
- Led pin x? ( ± 100 )
- Capacitor 33µF x1
- Resistor 40Ω x2
- Resistor 1kΩ x1
- Resistor 10kΩ x1
- Resistor 25Ω x1
- Resistor 220Ω x8
- Power Supply x1
- Breadboard x? ( ±16 )

---

**Voltage : 5.4V**

Remember to use Power Supply instead of using Battery! This is too dangerous if you use battery! but if you are an engineer like me that you can use physics, of course you can use batteries ( definitely with a method )!

Thanks~!
